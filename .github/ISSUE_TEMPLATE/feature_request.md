To ensure we fully understand your suggestion and can evaluate it effectively, please provide detailed information in the sections below. Use clear, concise language and include examples where possible.

## Problem Description
Is this feature request related to a specific problem or pain point? If so, describe it clearly and concisely. Explain the context, including how it affects users or workflows.  
Example: "I'm always frustrated when switching between multiple tabs, as it disrupts my productivity during data analysis."

If the request is not tied to a problem (e.g., a new enhancement idea), feel free to note that here or skip to the next section.

## Desired Solution
Provide a clear and concise description of the feature or change you would like to see implemented. Focus on the desired outcome, user experience, and any key functionalities.  
Example: "Add a multi-tab management system that allows pinning tabs and quick switching via keyboard shortcuts."

## Alternatives Considered
Describe any alternative solutions, workarounds, or similar features you've explored or thought about. Explain why they may or may not suffice. This helps us understand the broader context and potential trade-offs.  
Example: "I've tried using browser extensions for tab management, but they lack integration with our app's core tools and often cause performance issues."
