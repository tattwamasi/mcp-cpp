## Implementation Timeline (Total: 18 weeks)

1. **HTTP/SSE Transport**: Weeks 1-4
2. **Session Implementation**: Weeks 5-9
3. **Tool/Resource/Prompt Implementation**: Weeks 10-16
4. **Integration and Testing**: Weeks 17-18

## Key Milestones

1. **Week 4**: Complete HTTP/SSE transport with streaming support
2. **Week 9**: Finalized session implementations
3. **Week 16**: Complete tool, resource, and prompt capabilities
4. **Week 18**: Full MCP-CPP implementation with documentation

## Resource Requirements

- 2-3 C++ developers with experience in networking and async programming
- 1 QA engineer for testing
- Access to testing infrastructure for cross-platform validation
- Development environments for all target platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS)

## Risk Management

1. **Libcurl Integration**: May require adapters for complex scenarios
   - Mitigation: Create abstraction layer for HTTP client implementation

2. **Threading Model**: Complex async operations could introduce race conditions
   - Mitigation: Thorough thread safety review and stress testing

3. **Schema Validation**: Performance impact of runtime validation
   - Mitigation: Optional validation with compile-time checking where possible

4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Different behavior across platforms
   - Mitigation: Platform-specific tests and conditional compilation
